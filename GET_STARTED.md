## 🎨 What Makes This Special

### 1. Multi-Source Aggregation
Unlike other weather apps that use a single source, this app combines data from multiple APIs for increased accuracy.

### 2. Confidence Scores
See how much different sources agree. High confidence = reliable data.

### 3. Transparent Data
View individual source data to see variations and understand the aggregation.

### 4. Production Ready
Complete error handling, caching, responsive design, and documentation.

### 5. Educational
Learn about data aggregation, API integration, React patterns, and more.

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module" errors
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### API calls failing
- Check your `.env` file exists and has valid keys
- Verify you haven't exceeded rate limits
- The app works with just 1-2 sources

### Port 3000 in use
```bash
npm run dev -- --port 3001
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Test with just OpenWeatherMap first
2. **Add More Sources**: More sources = better accuracy
3. **Check Confidence**: Low confidence? Add more API keys
4. **Use Caching**: Default 10 minutes reduces API calls
5. **Mobile Test**: The UI is mobile-first and responsive
6. **Explore Source View**: Click "View Sources" to see individual data
